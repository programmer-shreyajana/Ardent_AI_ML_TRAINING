## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a 2nd-year B.Sc in Computer Science student at **Haldia Institute of Management** (4th Semester), passionate about Python, data analysis, and Machine Learning. I enjoy building projects that solve real problems and learning modern AI tools.

I completed a hands-on **AI/ML Workshop (Ardent)** and built real projects in Google Colab, which I've organized and pushed to GitHub. Guided by my mentor **SK Sahil** (AI Developer & Tutor at Code_ScholarEU), I've developed foundational skills in ML model development, EDA, and GitHub workflows.

> 🤖 Currently exploring: Supervised Learning • Automation Workflows • LLM Applications

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 Project 1: EDA Dashboard — Titanic Dataset
> Exploratory Data Analysis • Visual Insights

A beginner-friendly EDA project where I loaded a real-world dataset, cleaned missing values, created visualizations, and derived meaningful insights.

**What I did:**
- Loaded and explored dataset columns using **Pandas**
- Handled missing values using mean and mode imputation
- Created visualizations: survival count, gender vs. survival, age distribution
- Summarized key insights clearly (presentation-ready)

**Tech Stack:** `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `Data Cleaning` `Insights`

### 🏠 Project 2: House Price Prediction — Linear Regression
> Supervised ML • Model Evaluation (RMSE, R²)

My first supervised Machine Learning model — trained on real data to predict house prices on unseen test sets.

**What I did:**
- Performed **train-test split** for unbiased evaluation
- Trained model using **scikit-learn's** LinearRegression
- Evaluated performance with **RMSE** and **R² score**
- Visualized **Actual vs. Predicted** values and residual errors

**Tech Stack:** `scikit-learn` `Linear Regression` `RMSE` `R²` `Matplotlib`
